This is the {\em acknowledgements} environment, defined in
{\tt otagothesis.sty}.  If you have any preface material, this is where to
put it.  

I would like to thank the following people:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Department of Computer Science, for employing me over the
  Summer break in 1997/8;
  \item My colleagues in the Database Lab, who {\em still} haven't
  complained about the mess;
  \item Janet, who puts up with me.
  \end{itemize}
Thank you all.
