An abstract should be somewhere between 50 and
200 words long---the
absolute maximum at Otago is 500 words, but that is almost certainly
too long.  Remember, you will probably get at least one article out of
your thesis and it would be nice to be able to recycle the abstract
without having to snip it.

All you need to do in the abstract is give a statement of the problem,
a {\em brief} explanation of the method and procedures used, and a
summary of conclusions.  You do {\bf not} have to give away your
conclusions entirely; save that for the concluding chapter.  Bear in
mind that the abstract is all that most people will bother to read, so
it had better be good!
