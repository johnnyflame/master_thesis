%% This is a document template for an Otago thesis (Masters or PhD).
%% A skeleton chapter layout is also suggested.
%%
%% Look in the directory example_document for filled-out chapters
%% that show you how to do figures, bibliographies, and tables.
%%
%% Since this was written for Computer Science at Otago University,
%% Harvard (author, date) style citations are used.  Other students
%% should consult their advisors as to what style of citations to use.

%% This template was created by Nathan Rountree 9/2/98
%% Updates have since been made by others in the department.
